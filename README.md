Password Generator
The purpose of this code is to create a user defined password generator

The user is prompted with a series of questions that determines the length and types of characters that are used in the password generation
The users responses are stored in an object that is used to guarantee a randomly generated character from the specific user defined characters
Then the program randomly assigns characters until it meets the proper user defined length and prints that image on the screen
